To Do List.

[x] Make the corners change color when the player steps on them
[x] Make the game end when a player has stepped on three corners
[x] Since the game class deals with input, give the game class the 
   ability to call the draw functions itself whenever there is a new
   event.
[] Sound effects?
[] Make some sort of How-to for the user to see how to play the game.
   (This could involve a tutorial where the user is forced to press certain
   buttons)
[] Make blocks prevent users from standing in that place
    move function will have to test the x, y location and see if there is a
	block there before
	it validates move.
	The map will be hard coded.

[] Comment functions, clean code.
[] Figure out Ruby usage of underscores and camelCase for 
    variables and functions and modify code accordingly.
	
[] Make a map loader (We can manually populate the list of maps to select)
[] Or make maps randomly generate!

[x] Make some sort of end-game sequence.

[X] Make the main menu open the app.
I assume this will require putting the main menu into our main.rb.

In the Project Description I read that we should have images EVERYWHERE so 
we should spice up our main menu.
